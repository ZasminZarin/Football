            <h4>Summary of the match</h4>
            <summary>
                The match began after a minute of silence for victims of the COVID-19 pandemic, with Argentina leading in possession and early chances. Brazilian midfielder Fred received a yellow card in the third minute for a challenge on Gonzalo Montiel, beginninga
                series of fouls from players on both teams. Ángel Di María opened the scoring for Argentina in the 22nd minute, receiving a long pass from Rodrigo De Paul and beating defender Renan Lodi to lob the ball over the advancing goalkeeper Ederson.
                Brazil responded with a series of attacks, including one that forced a save out of Emiliano Martínez, but lost possession to an Argentina counter-attack that ended in a missed shot from Lionel Messi after the half-hour mark. The first
                half ended with a 1–0 lead for Argentina.
                <br> After a pair of chances for Brazil that were repelled by Martínez, Argentina sprung on a counterattack in the 88th minute that ended with Messi stumbling while trying to dribble around Ederson. The match ended in a 1–0 victory for
                Argentina, securing their first Copa América title since 1993.
